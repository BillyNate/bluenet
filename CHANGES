Version 1.6.0:
 - Add release config for crownstone_1.6.0

 - Added more doc comments to pwm and adc.
 - Found the source of the wrong dimmer temp voltage, now set the correct values. Gain of differential ADC was calculated wrongly as well.
 - Adjusted dimmer temp voltages for acr01b6a and acr01b2e. Still not well calibrated.
 - Set pwm temp pin. Removed boards crownstone5 and flexprint.
 - Merge branch 'master' of github.com:crownstone/bluenet
 - Remove README symbols.
 - Fixed set/get switch state.
 - Cleaned up pwm a bit.
 - Enabled temperatureguard again
 - No need for nrf_drv of timer, ppi, gpiote anymore.
 - Set pwm to be called on zero crossing.
 - Zero crossing is now nicely implemented: configurable and decoupled.
 - Set some board config fields.
 - Update documentation.sh script, publish target
 - Update release script documentation. Remove docs/html
 - Ignore docs/html
 - TemperatureGuard: added support for inverted dimmer temperature sensors. *untested*
 - Don't use nrf_drv for timer1.
 - ADC: configurable gain and mode per channel, configurable zero crossing callback, use HAL for timer and ppi instead of the nrf_drv. Power sampling: undid changes for now (use averaging again).
 - When the user wants to dim at 99%, assume the user actually wants full on, but doesn't want to use the relay.
 - Deprecated: ADC sample rate, power sample interval, power sample cont num samples.
 - Added todo: delayed start of mesh.
 - Working pwm, which changes duty cycle via ppi enable, without interrupt. Syncing to zero crossings still uses interrupt.
 - Added colors to logs.
 - Started working on a different way to set pwm value.
 - Tried to fix the gpio state at start of period, didn't work yet.
 - Don't write pstorage when only pwm changes.

 - updated the encryption to all go through the .encrypt method. Introduces Encryption types enum. Made sessionNonce cafebabe ECB encrypted. Redesigned setup phase so we do not need to bond. Bonding causes issues with iphones which want to bond after setup as well. Iphones cannot clear the bonded history programmatically. Power service is not encrypted because it is using the encryption buffer. We need to rethink the providing of buffers to the characteristic. Added safeguard for disconnect in stack, now checks if we are even connected.  Removed ancient code. Removed a lot of commented out blocks, we have git for history. Fixed few bugs. Removed restoration of high tx on bonding due to security concerns. Updated protocol doc to 0.6 to include the new characteristics and encryption state of setup and power service

Added safeguard for disconnect in stack, now checks if we are even connected.  Removed ancient code. Removed a lot of commented out blocks, we have git for history. Fixed few bugs. Removed restoration of high tx on bonding due to security concerns. Updated protocol doc to 0.6 to include the new characteristics and encryption state of setup and power service

 - Separate headers and sources. Stubs for protocol files. Adjust the AD file, because it interfers with the softdevice, not finished though.
 - Merge with restructuring from Dominik
 - error in loop, debug code instead of real temperature value
 - build fix
 - Plot voltage curve
 - Merge pull request #4 from vliedel/master
 - added adc, added compile date as device name
 - Merge branch 'cleaned' of github.com:dobots/bluenet into cleaned
 - Notifications fixed TemperatureService fixed iBeacon functionality added Characteristic properties fixed BLE scan result stored (initial version)
 - Notifications fixed TemperatureService fixed iBeacon functionality added Characteristic properties fixed BLE scan result stored (initial version)
 - bugfix for more than one custom service
 - log, uart and temperature code moved to headers. services moved to separate files
 - experimenting with pwm
 - cleaned out the code. deleted everything that was not necessary!! code compiles, uploads and runs still.
 - add volatile, see http://hg.cmason.com/nrf/commits/dcf31efcc133c8ad5cd2dd67f763c85764538a9b?at=default
 - remove unused vars, see http://hg.cmason.com/nrf/commits/fed71cdc1af26f0168463928ed58df9f196d0d63?at=default
 - Use SOFTDEVICE_DIR_API and preserve SOFTDEVICE_DIR
 - Merge pull request #3 from vliedel/master
 - use SOFTDEVICE_API_DIR
 - Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/mrquincle/bluenet
 - bash instead of sh
 - Update how to upload firmware
 - Add other default configuration options
 - Add SERIES in default config
 - Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/mrquincle/bluenet
 - these scripts should run with bash
 - Add support for uart in separate serial.h/cpp files
 - Correct writing to UART.
 - Playing around with UART
 - Set RAM space to correct value, 6kB, not 10kB as wrongly indicated in the spec from Nordic
 - Adjust available FLASH for application with larger s130
 - Add defaults for RAM values for SoftDevice
 - RAM_R1_BASE parameter for S130. Still heap seems to be overwritten or other issues are at hand
 - Update default start address for s130 softdevice
 - Feed configuration options also through the preprocessor/compiler.
 - Compiles properly with the S130 softdevice, but it doesn't seem to get up yet
 - Set default to S110 v7
 - Make softdevice 7 and sdk 6 compilable
 - Add tiny bit on usage of Crownstone
 - Older
 - Default config file update to several softdevice options
 - Updating to SoftDevice v7 is a hassle. There are quite some ABI/API changes. Not done yet.
 - Use parameters to define the size of the SoftDevice and start address of the application
 - Correct upload script for softdevice
 - DoBots inside
 - Explain more in the README.md about the installation process
 - Rewrote building process, so it is more reliable, emits less errors (which are no errors). Use CMake so configuration is easy adjusted. Generate object files in separate folder, so it is less cluttered.
 - Working PWM, but code is now very ugly
 - Remove temp files
 - Remove redundant files. Working on analogWrite as in Arduino code
 - Remove redundant files. Working on analogWrite as in Arduino code
 - Working for the RFduino
 - Sending RSSI values in main_ble.cpp
 - Grammar
 - Update year
 - Commit from hg repos by Mason
