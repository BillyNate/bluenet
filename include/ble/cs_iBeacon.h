/** Implementation of the iBeacon specification.
 *
 * The implementation of the iBeacon specification is only about advertising at predefined intervals and
 * casting a payload (the manufacturing data of an advertisement package) in the form of a specific
 * structure:
 *
 *  * iBeacon Prefix
 *  * proximity UUID. An identifier which should be used to distinguish your beacons from others (for a
 *    given application, all of your iBeacons share the same UUID), the individual iBeacons are then
 *    distinguished by major and minor numbers
 *  * major (group level identifier, e.g. on the level of a building, unique amongst all nodes with a
 *    given proximity UUID)
 *  * minor (individual nodes, unique amongst all nodes with a given proximity UUID and major number)
 *  * rssi value (known rssi value at 1m distance, used to calculate actual distance from the iBeacon)
 *
 * Note that you might not be able to use this commercially! Although I would be surprised if it is possible
 * to patent a "struct" or the Apple prefix.

	 * is correct and doesn't need to be converted anymore to be used in the advertisement data.
