/**
 * We are only storing data to the persistent storage in form of
 * structs, every value that needs to be stored has to be encapsulated
 * inside a struct with base class ps_storage_base_t. Each service that
 * needs to store data get's a struct which it takes care of. Values are
 * written and read to that struct, which is a local copy of the data
 * in memory. Changes to values are only kept once that struct is
 * written to memory.
 *
 * Adding a new element to the storage requires the following steps:
 *
 *   1. define an ID for the service in the enum ps_storage_id
 *   2. define a new struct with the elements that should be stored for
 *      this service, with base class ps_storage_base_t
 *   3. add a new element to the config array found in storage.cpp
 *      in the form of:
 *   	  {ENUM_ID, {}, sizeof(struct)}
 *   4. Increase PSTORAGE_MAX_APPLICATIONS in pstorage_platform.h
 *      by one
 *
 *  NOTE: we can't store less than 4 bytes, so even if you only want
 *    to store a byte, the element in the struct has to be defined as
 *    uint32_t
