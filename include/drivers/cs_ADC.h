/** Analog-Digital conversion.
 *
 * The ADC is a hardware peripheral that can be initialized for a particular pin. Subsequently, the analog signal
 * is converted into a digital value. The resolution of the conversion is limited (default 10 bits). The conversion
 * is used to get the current curve.
 *
 * There is only one ADC hardware peripheral, hence this class conforms to the singleton design pattern. 
 *
 * The constructor does NOT have arguments you might expect, such as the number of buffers to use, or the size of the 
 * buffers. These are all set through preprocessor macros. The ADC class requires access to the following macros
 * (see below).
 *
 * The timer used to get new samples on regular time intervals. The timer should be able to run on at least 2kHz to
 * be able to get the fine-grained current and voltage data we want.
 *
 *   - CS_ADC_TIMER                    The timer peripheral to use for the ADC peripheral.
 *   - CS_ADC_INSTANCE_INDEX           The instance id of the timer. TODO: What is this?
 *   - CS_ADC_TIMER_ID                 TODO: What is this?
 *
 * The buffers to be used internally. To have these buffers in the form of macros means that we can check at compile
 * time if they are small enough with respect to the nRF52 memory limitations.
 *
 *   - CS_ADC_NUM_BUFFERS              The number of ADC buffers to use. 
 *   - CS_ADC_BUF_SIZE                 The size of the buffer (first time used in init()).
 *
 * The pins:
 *
 *   - CS_ADC_MAX_PINS                 The maximum number of pins available for ADC.
 *
 * The sequence of events is as follows:
 *
 * 1. The C interrupt service routine, saadc_callback(nrf_drv_saadc_evt_t const * p_event) can be found in the 
 * corresponding implementation file. This function uses the singleton feature to call update on an event from the 
 * ADC peripheral, in particular, NRF_DRV_SAADC_EVT_DONE, with a buffer as argument.
 *
 * 2. The update() routine puts an internal C function, adc_done, with _doneCallback as argument in the event queue
 * of the scheduler. This calls the callback function set previously in setDoneCallback() by a particular caller, 
 * e.g. the cs_PowerSampling. In this particular case it ends up in PowerSampling::powerSampleAdcDone that after 
 * processing the data calls releaseBuffer(bufNum).
 *
 * 3. The releaseBuffer function clears the _doneCallbackData structure and queues a new buffer. Note that all 
 * processing has taken place by now.
 
 * Note. In the ADC it is assumed that the member object is not updated (_doneCallbackData.bufName == bufNum) in the
 * mean while. In other words, it should not be possible to get a second interrupt before releaseBuffer has been 
 * called. Scheduling a new ADC task is only done at the end of the releaseBuffer function.
