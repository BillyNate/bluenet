# UART Protocol
---------------

## Special characters

There are two special characters:
- Start: `0x7E`
- Escape: `0x5C`

Every byte in the UART message that equals one of the special characters will be XORed by `0x40`, and prepended by the escape character.

## Wrapper

Every UART message is wrapped.

Type | Name | Length | Description

uint8   | Start   | 1 | Start of a message.
uint16  | OpCode  | 2 | Type of message.
uint16  | Size    | 2 | Size of the message in bytes.
uint8[] | Message | N | The message.
uint16  | CRC     | 2 | The CRC16 of OpCode, Size, and message.

## RX OpCodes

Opcodes for messages received by the Crownstone.
