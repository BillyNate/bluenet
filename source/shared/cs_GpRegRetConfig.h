/**
 * Values in GPREGRET used to remember things after a reboot.
 *
 * We don't use the NRF_BL_DFU_ENTER_METHOD_GPREGRET method, instead we use our own implementation.
 *
 * However, we do use NRF_BL_DFU_ENTER_METHOD_GPREGRET in the bootloader once it decided to go into DFU mode,
 * to avoid modifications to nrf_bootloader.c.
 * This means that if GPREGRET == 1011 0001 (counter=17, brownout=true, storage_recovered=true), the bootloader will also go into DFU mode.
 *
 * We use 5 bits of GPREGRET as counter. Each boot, the bootloader increases the count by 1.
 * Once the counter is at its max, the bootloader will go into DFU mode.
 * A minute or so after boot, the app will set GPREGRET to 0.
 * This means that if the app crashes quickly after boot, it will end up in DFU mode.
 *
 * In case the bootloader is updated, but the app not:
 * The old app will set GPREGRET to CS_GPREGRET_LEGACY_DFU_RESET when it wants to got to DFU mode.
 * This case should be handled by the bootloader for now.
 *
 * The remaining bits are used as flags.
