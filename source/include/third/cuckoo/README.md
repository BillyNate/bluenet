Cuckoo Filter Library
=====================
This library is forked from the public [github repository](https://github.com/jonahharris/libcuckoofilter) and initially added to
bluenet on 19-02-2021. Code has been extensively refactored for idiomatic use in C++ and many implementation details have changed
e.g. to fix implicit narrowing/widening of integers, large recursion and type punning in allocations.
