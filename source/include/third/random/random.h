*  Middle Square Weyl Sequence Random Number Generator                     *
*                                                                          *
*  msws() - returns a 32 bit unsigned int [0,0xffffffff]                   *
*                                                                          *
*  The state vector consists of three 64 bit words:  x, w, and s           *
*                                                                          *
*  x - random output [0,0xffffffff]                                        *
*  w - Weyl sequence (period 2^64)                                         *
*  s - an odd constant                                                     *
*                                                                          *
*  The Weyl sequence is added to the square of x.  The middle is extracted *
*  by shifting right 32 bits:                                              *
*                                                                          *
*  x *= x; x += (w += s); return x = (x>>32) | (x<<32);                    *
*                                                                          *
*  The constant s should be set to a random 64-bit pattern.  The utility   *
*  init_rand_digits in init.h may be used to initialize the constant.      *
*  This utility generates constants with different hexadecimal digits.     *
*  This assures sufficient change in the Weyl sequence on each iteration   *
*  of the RNG.                                                             *
*                                                                          *
*  Note:  This version of the RNG includes an idea proposed by             *
*  Richard P. Brent (creator of the xorgens RNG).  Brent suggested         *
*  adding the Weyl sequence after squaring instead of before squaring.     *
*  This provides a basis for uniformity in the output.                     *
*                                                                          *
