 * Store values in FLASH or RAM. Load values from FIRMWARE_DEFAULT, FLASH or RAM.
 *
 * 1. Values that are written fairly often and are not important over reboots should be stored in and read from RAM.
 * For example, we can measure continuously the temperature of the chip. We can also all the time read this value
 * from one of the BLE services. There is no reason to do a roundtrip to FLASH.
 *
 * 2. Values like CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY should be known over reboots of the device. Moreover, they should also persist
 * over firmware updates. These values are stored in FLASH. If the values are actually not changed by the user (or via
 * the smartphone app), they should NOT be stored to FLASH. They can then immediately be read from the
 * FIRMWARE_DEFAULT. They will be stored only if they are explicitly overwritten. If these values are stored in FLASH
 * they always take precedence over FIRMWARE_DEFAULT values.
 *
 * 3. Most values can be written to and read from FLASH using RAM as a cache. We can also use FIRMWARE_DEFAULT as
 * a fallback when the FLASH value is not present. Moreover, we can have a list that specifies if a value should be
 * in RAM or in FLASH by default. This complete persistence strategy is called STRATEGY1.
 *
 * NOTE. Suppose we have a new firmware available and we definitely want to use a new FIRMWARE_DEFAULT value. For
 * example, we use more peripherals and need to have a CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY that is higher or else it will be in an
 * infinite reboot loop. Before we upload the new firmware to the Crownstone, we need to explicitly clear the value.
 * Only after we have deleted the FLASH record we can upload the new firmware. Then the new FIRMWARE_DEFAULT is used
 * automatically.
