/**
 * This class keeps track of the real time in the current time zone.
 * It may obtain its data through the mesh, or some other way and try
 * to keep up to date using on board timing functionality.
 *
 * This class also synchronizes time with other nodes in the mesh.
 * The node with the lowest ID is considered to be the root clock.
 * Other nodes will update their time on receival of time sync messages from the root clock.
 *
 * There are some scenarios to consider here:
 * 1. No node knows the actual posix time: in this case we still want a synchronized clock.
 * 2. Nodes are all just booted, but not at the same time: they should still synchronize quickly.
 * 3. Nodes are all booted at the same time.
 * 4. A node that's not the root clock receives a set time command, this time should overrule the root clock time.
 *
 * This is solved by:
 * 1. Update the clock even when no posix time is known, but mark it to be invalid with a low version.
 * 2. Only consider ourselves to be root ID after the first time sync message is received.
 * 2. On boot, each node will request to be synchronized (a mechanism already in the mesh). Every other node that
 *    considers themselves to be in sync, will send their clock.
 *    It's up to the receiving node to device which clock to use.
 * 3. In this case we expect all nodes to be waiting for the first message to be sent.
 * 4. Add a lollipop version to the clock: a newer version will always be accepted, even if it's not the root ID.
 *
 * For robustness, not only the root clock node, but all nodes will regularly send a time sync message.
 * It's up to the receiving node to device which clock is the root clock.
 * Not sure if this is necessary.
