# Snippets

Explanation of the code using little snippets... Not necessarily meant as test units, but can be expanded to it.

## Configuration

The configuration is explained through `control.c`. There is some care taken on how to pass environmental variables are precompile values towards the program in a way that they do not need to be dynamically allocated, but which is still safe.
