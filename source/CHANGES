 - updated the encryption to all go through the .encrypt method. Introduces Encryption types enum. Made sessionNonce cafebabe ECB encrypted. Redesigned setup phase so we do not need to bond. Bonding causes issues with iphones which want to bond after setup as well. Iphones cannot clear the bonded history programmatically. Power service is not encrypted because it is using the encryption buffer. We need to rethink the providing of buffers to the characteristic. Added safeguard for disconnect in stack, now checks if we are even connected.  Removed ancient code. Removed a lot of commented out blocks, we have git for history. Fixed few bugs. Removed restoration of high tx on bonding due to security concerns. Updated protocol doc to 0.6 to include the new characteristics and encryption state of setup and power service
