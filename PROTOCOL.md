# Advertisements and scan response
When no device is connected, [advertisements](#ibeacon_packet) will be sent at a regular interval (100ms by default). A device that actively scans, will also receive a [scan response packet](#scan_response_packet). This contains useful info about the state.

### <a name="mesh_message_packet"></a>Mesh message packet
This packet is a slightly modified version of the one used in [OpenMesh](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF51-ble-bcast-mesh); we simply increased the content size.

uint 8 | OpCode | 1 | See available op codes in table below
uint 8 | Payload | |

Opcode | Type name | Payload type | Payload description
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | Data | [Mesh data update](#mesh_data_update_packet) | Single part notification (if all data fits in one packet).
1 | Flag Set | | Not used.
2 | Flag Req | | Not used.
17 | Cmd Rsp | | Not used.
18 | Flag Rsp | | Not used.
32 | MultipartStart | [Mesh data update](#mesh_data_update_packet) | First part of the multi part notification.

34 | MultipartEnd | [Mesh data update](#mesh_data_update_packet) | Last part of the multi part notification.

### <a name="mesh_data_update_packet"></a>Mesh data update packet
Each mesh data message is notified in multiple pieces, as a notification can only be 20 bytes. The op code of the [Mesh notification](#mesh_notification_packet) tells whether it is a single, or the first, last or a middle piece of a multipart message.

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint 16 | Handle | 2 | Handle on which the messages was sent or received.
uint 8 | Length | 1 | Length of the data of this part.
uint 8 | Data | Length | Data of this part. If OpCode is Data, it is the length of the whole mesh message, otherwise it is the length of the current part.
