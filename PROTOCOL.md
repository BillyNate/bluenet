# Bluenet protocol v0.5.1
-------------------------

# <a name="encryption"></a>Encryption
By default, Crownstones have encryption enabled as a security and privacy measure.

#### Why don't you use the Bluetooth Bonding?

Bluetooth bonding in Bluetooth V4 creates a secure link between user and device. There are a few downsides of this method which we will explain here:
- Before Bluetooth 4.2 (which introduces Elliptical Curve Hellman-Diffie) the initial exchange of the keys is not secure.
- Bluetooth 4.2 is not supported on the majority of phones at the time of writing.
- Every user needs to bond with each Crownstone.
- Every Crownstone stores a key for each user with whom it has bonded, thereby limiting the total amount of possible users.
- The secure bonding does not secure the scan response advertisements.

#### Why not use Apple Homekit?

This is on the roadmap for future releases and will work with the currently available Crownstones but at the moment Apple Homekit is not supported on Android.

#### Setup mode
When a Crownstone is new or factory reset, it will go into setup mode.

Setup mode turns down the power of the antenna (low TX) so you can only communicate with it when you're close by. The purpose of this mode
is to configure the Crownstone so only you, or people in your group, can communicate with it.

The protocol here is as follows:

1. Crownstone is in setup mode (low TX, [Setup Service active](#setup_service))
- Phone is close and bonds with the Crownstone
- Phone reads the Crownstone [MAC address](#setup_service) (required for iOS)
- Phone starts setting up the Crownstone using the [Config Control](#setup_service) Characteristic
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its identifier](#crownstone_identifier)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Admin key](#admin_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the User key](#user_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Guest key](#guest_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Mesh Access Address](#mesh_access_address)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon UUID](#ibeacon_uuid)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon Major](#ibeacon_major)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon Minor](#ibeacon_minor)
- Phone commands Crownstone [to leave setup mode](#validate_setup)

### Using Encryption

When encryption is enabled the following changes:

- The [scan response packet service data](#scan_response_servicedata_packet) will be encrypted using the Guest key.
- Values that are **read from** the characteristics will be encrypted
- Values that are **written to** the characteristics will have to be encrypted

#### Writing to characteristics

After connecting, you first have to read the [session nonce](#session_nonce). This session nonce has two purposes. It is used to authenticate any commands that are written (as a checksum of sorts) and secondly it forms part of the Nonce used for encryption.
The session nonce is only valid during the connection.

The session nonce is [ECB encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29) with the Guest key. To verify you have read and decrypted succesfully, check if the validation key is equal to **0xcafebabe**.

We use the [AES 128 CTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_.28CTR.29) method to encrypt everything that is written to- and read from characteristics. For this you need to generate an 8 byte number called a **nonce**. The first 3 bytes of the nonce are sent with each packet, we call this the packet nonce. The last 5 bytes of the nonce are called the [session nonce](#session_nonce), which should be read after connecting.

##### Encrypted Packet

![Encrypted packet](docs/diagrams/encrypted-packet.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint 8 | Packet nonce | 3 | First 3 bytes of nonce used in the encryption of this message.
uint 8 | User level | 1 | 0: Admin, 1: User, 2: Guest
[Encrypted Payload](#encrypted_payload) | Encrypted Payload | N*16 | The encrypted payload of N blocks.

![Encrypted payload](docs/diagrams/encrypted-payload.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description

byte array | payload |  | Whatever data would have been sent if encryption was disabled.
byte array | padding |  | Zero-padding so that the whole packet is of size N*16 bytes

#### Receiving scan response packages

The [scan response service data](#scan_response_servicedata_packet) packet will be encrypted using the [ECB method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29) using the guest key.
You receive a MAC address on Android and an UUID on iOS for each advertisement packet. This allows you to get the Crownstone ID associated with the packet and you verify the decryption by checking the expected Crownstone ID against the one in the packet.

# Advertisements and scan response
When no device is connected, [advertisements](#ibeacon_packet) will be sent at a regular interval (100ms by default). A device that actively scans, will also receive a [scan response packet](#scan_response_packet). This contains useful info about the state.

### <a name="ibeacon_packet"></a>iBeacon advertisement packet

Bit 7 is used for the relay flag, where 0 = OFF, 1 = ON.
Bits 6-0 are used for PWM, where 100 is fully ON, 0 is OFF, dimmed in between.

OpCodes:

OpCode | Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | Read | Select the configuration setting for reading. will load it from storage, then write it to the Config Read Characteristic. Length and payload of the configuration packet will be ignored
1 | Write | Write the state variable **disabled**
2 | Notify | Enable/Disable notifications for state variable. Every time the state variable is updated, the new value is written to the State Read Characteristic. To use effectively, enable GATT Notifications on the State Read Characteristic. Length has to be 1, and payload is 0 = disable, other = enable

Note: On the State Read Characteristic, the OpCode is also set to distinguish between a one time read, and a continuous notification. In return, the length and payload will have actual data depending on the type.
